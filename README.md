FizzBuzz Kata (python)
==================

This is an implementation of the FizzBuzz code kata in python.

The objective of the kata is to return a value based on the input number.

If the number is divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9, etc.), then the number is replaced with the word 'fizz'.

If the number is divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc.), then the number is replaced with the word 'buzz'.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15, 30, 45, etc.), then the number is replaced with the word 'fizzbuzz'.

All other non-fizzbuzz numbers are returned as the number itself.

The result starting from 1 would then be:
1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, 16, 17, etc.
